# Escape-VR
An Asymmetric Multiplayer Virtual Reality Escape Room

EscapeVR started as my Senior Project for my bachelor’s degree, throughout the process as I taught myself Unity, C#, and Oculus it evolved into what it is now. 
This project was completely re-written into a multiplayer experience within the last six weeks of the semester. I created local multiplayer through a WebSocket built in python. Using C# to create the WebSocket client scripts as well as the ‘game controller’ script.
